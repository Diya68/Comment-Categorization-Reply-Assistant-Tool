# Comment-Categorization-Reply-Assistant-Tool
Leveraging NLP, this project categorizes user comments (praise, hate, criticism, spam, etc.) to help teams respond efficiently. Features include ML-powered analysis, flexible input/output, and optional UI/visualizations. Python-based with scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK/spaCy, and HuggingFace Transformers. Ideal for enhancing feedback management.




# Problem Statement 
Users post a wide variety of comments. These could be:
- Appreciative (praise/support)
- Emotional
- Abusive (hate/threat)
- Constructively negative (e.g., I didn't like the design but appreciate the effort)
- Spam or irrelevant
- Questions or suggestions

The tool must sort comments into buckets so that the team can:
- Engage positively
- Address genuine criticism
- Ignore spam
- Escalate threats/hate
- Provide answers where needed
