# Comment-Categorization-Reply-Assistant-Tool
Leveraging NLP, this project categorizes user comments (praise, hate, criticism, spam, etc.) to help teams respond efficiently. Features include ML-powered analysis, flexible input/output, and optional UI/visualizations. Python-based with scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK/spaCy, and HuggingFace Transformers. Ideal for enhancing feedback management.

# Objective 
The objective of this project is to combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a machine learning model trained on a proprietary dataset to categorize user comments into predetermined groups. Real-world conversational contexts are represented by the manually gathered and categorized comments in the dataset. Following classification, an automatically generated suggested response that fits the anticipated category is also provided by the system. For applications like automated help, social engagement, and content moderation, the project incorporates an intuitive Gradio interface that allows users to enter comments and receive results instantaneously. 

# Problem Statement 
Users post a wide variety of comments. These could be:
- Appreciative (praise/support)
- Emotional
- Abusive (hate/threat)
- Constructively negative (e.g., I didn't like the design but appreciate the effort)
- Spam or irrelevant
- Questions or suggestions

The tool must sort comments into buckets so that the team can:
- Engage positively
- Address genuine criticism
- Ignore spam
- Escalate threats/hate
- Provide answers where needed
